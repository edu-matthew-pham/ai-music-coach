// mixerPanels.svelte.ts
//
// Which panels are showing.
//
// A group jam on a big screen wants different things
// visible than one person practising alone at a laptop -
// rather than build one fixed layout, each panel can be
// shown or hidden independently. This is deliberately
// separate from mixerEngine.svelte.ts: visibility knows
// nothing about audio, and every panel that reads it is
// just displaying a slice of the engine's state, not
// touching playback.
//
// Adding a new panel later - note boxes, an instrument
// diagram - means adding one more entry here and one new
// component, not redesigning this or the engine.
//
// Module-scoped for the same reason everything else
// persistent is: Gradio tears the component down and
// rebuilds it on every event round trip, and a toggle
// someone chose should not silently revert because an
// unrelated click happened to trigger a remount.
